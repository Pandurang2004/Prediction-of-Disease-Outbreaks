# Prediction-of-Disease-outbreaks

This project is a machine learning-based web application designed to predict the likelihood of various diseases based on user-inputted health parameters. The system includes predictions for:

✅ Diabetes✅ Heart Disease✅ Parkinson’s Disease

# 🖥️ Project Overview

The web application provides a simple, interactive UI where users can enter their medical data, such as blood pressure, glucose levels, BMI, insulin levels, and more, to receive predictions on potential diseases. The model processes this data and provides real-time results.

# 🚀 Features

🔹 User-friendly interface built with Streamlit

🔹 Multiple disease predictions (Diabetes, Heart Disease, Parkinson’s)

🔹 Machine learning models trained on relevant datasets

🔹 Real-time results based on user input

# 🛠️ Tech Stack

🔹 Frontend: Streamlit

🔹 Backend: Python

🔹 Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy

# ❓ What is Streamlit?

Streamlit is an open-source Python library that makes it easy to create and deploy interactive web applications for data science and machine learning projects. It allows users to build UI components using simple Python scripts without requiring extensive frontend development knowledge.
